I am a research scientist and PhD student in the field of machine learning and data mining at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. I focus on learning from sequential data, specifically the intersection between data stream mining and decision making under uncertainty. You can find my publications [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/publications.md %}) or on [google scholar]({{author.googlescholar}}).

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me at any time if you're interested in discussing research or collaboration opportunities, or simply to connect.
