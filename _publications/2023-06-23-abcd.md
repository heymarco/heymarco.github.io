excerpt: "Our paper presents ABCD, a novel approach for change detection in high-dimensional data streams. ABCD detects changes accurately and provides insights into the specific subspace where changes occur. By leveraging an encoder-decoder model and Bernstein's inequality, ABCD quantifies the severity of changes and outperforms other methods in our experiments."

Change detection is of fundamental importance when analyzing data streams. Detecting changes both quickly and accurately enables monitoring and prediction systems to react, e.g., by issuing an alarm or by updating a learning algorithm. However, detecting changes is challenging when observations are high-dimensional.

In high-dimensional data, change detectors should not only be able to identify when changes happen, but also in which subspace they occur. Ideally, one should also quantify how severe they are.
Our approach, ABCD, has these properties. ABCD learns an encoder-decoder model and monitors its accuracy over a window of adaptive size. ABCD derives a change score based on Bernstein's inequality to detect deviations in terms of accuracy, which indicate changes.

Our experiments demonstrate that ABCD outperforms its best competitor by at least 8% and up to 23% in F1-score on average. It can also accurately estimate changes' subspace, together with a severity measure that correlates with the ground truth.
